# Control_Of_Idendity_Card_For_Workers


This was my first project, and it was a group effort. We had a team of 4 people working on the project. Due to some issues close to the project deadline, we utilized an Arduino to read the RFID card reader and sent the data to the STM32. We managed its control through a C# interface. MS SQL was used in the project.
